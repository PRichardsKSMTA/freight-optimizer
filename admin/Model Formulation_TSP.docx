Freight Optimization
This formulation will maximize gross profit over a set of freight loads by determining the acceptance decision and optimal routing for a set of loads that can each be accepted or rejected by the trucking company. Specifically, the objective and constraints are:

Objective: Maximize the gross profit of active routes; gross profit is measured as the revenue from accepted loads minus the cost of servicing those loads plus the cost of empty legs.

Constraints:
All routes must be connected; origin-destination pairs that are not directly connected should be connected by an empty leg
A minimum margin % must be achieved across the network
All empty legs must have mileage below a certain threshold
The capacity of a truck is a single load at once


Sets, Parameters, and Variables
Sets
	Set of all origins and destinations
	Set of all trips. Each trip, , is indexed by an origin, , and a destination, 

Parameters
	The gross profit from trip  if trip  is assigned directly after . This is the gross profit from  minus the deadhead cost from the destination of  to the origin of .
	The revenue from trip  if trip  is assigned directly after . 
	The margin target for this optimization run
	The margin improvement to the solution if from trip  if trip  is assigned directly after . The margin improvement is measured as profit above (or below) the target margin this trip will provide: 

	The weight of the margin target component of the objective

Decision Variables
	Binary variable, with 1 indicating that trip  directly follows trip 







Formulation

The objective is to maximize gross profit plus the margin improvement component. The margin target component incentivizes the model to accept trips that produce margin above the margin target; increasing the weight of this component, , will improve the margin.



Each trip must be assigned as the origin of a connection at most once.



If a trip has an outgoing connection, it must also have an incoming connection.



Trip assignment is a binary variable.
